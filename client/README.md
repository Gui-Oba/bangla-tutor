# Gui Oba-Personal Portfolio Website
 
A website I built to showcase some projects and skills. Accomplished using **React + Vite**, with styling by **Tailwind CSS**. All vector images were made by me. Deployed using **Vercel**. 

I decided to use React + Vite due to the library's versatility and ease of use. Tailwind CSS allowed me to style the website to my liking, maintaining a clean, minimal aesthetic. Overall, the purpose of this program is straightforward, and did not necessitate much coding.

Vercel was used because its free and simple.
